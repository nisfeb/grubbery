::  migrations: agent state versions
::
::  The first real migration. The discipline established here:
::
::  A state version's types must be FROZEN — written against the shapes
::  as they were, not against live library types that keep moving. Only
::  the chain that actually changed is frozen; everything else refers
::  to live types precisely because it is unchanged. If a later change
::  touches a type a frozen chain refers to, that chain must deepen.
::
::  state-0 -> state-1: %make loads grew a gain=? flag (born-gained
::  grubs, no make-then-gain race). Loads persist in exactly one place:
::  pool process queues, via pend's [%veto =dart]. So the frozen chain
::  is load-0 -> dart-0 -> pend-0 -> take-0 -> proc-0 -> pipe-0 ->
::  pool-0. The process slot widens to * : +on-save's bang-pool
::  guarantees only %| tangs persist, and old continuations are never
::  resumed — they are replaced wholesale by the reload machinery.
