::  lib/git/action: types for the serial git command lane.
::
::    Defines the parsed +git-command a repo accepts, and the stateful
::    +action-state its action grub holds — a queue of pending commands, the
::    one active job (with its intermediate state, so a multi-step op can
::    resume after a restart), and a log of completed commands. The verb
::    grammars (built on /lib/git/cmd) and the dispatch to git operations get
::    layered on top of these types later.

::  +git-command: a parsed git verb + its parameters. One serial lane runs
::  these one at a time — a repo has a single working tree/index/HEAD, so
::  git operations must not interleave.
