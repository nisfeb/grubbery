::  rules: typed recurrence rules
::
::  A rule is a clock: it ticks at moments. An event is a clock plus
::  how long each tick lasts (extent), in what time-frame (frame),
::  over what range (start..dom, except). Those four axes are
::  orthogonal — the kind knows nothing of them.
::
::  A kind lives as a file in the namespace (/lib/rules/<name>.hoon)
::  and is a pure point generator: [args start idx] -> the naive
::  local left-moment of occurrence idx, or ~ if that index has no
::  occurrence (april 31st, non-leap feb 29). start anchors idx 0.
::  Occurrence n is closed-form in n — no iterating, no materialized
::  schedules.
::
::  +instance dresses each tick into concrete UTC spans:
::    extent decides the right edge — %instant (a point), %dur (a
::      fixed real-time length), or %until (a wall-clock end time,
::      rolling overnight if at/before the left edge).
::    frame decides projection — %date is timezone-independent (the
::      moment is a calendar day, UTC-anchored, never zone-shifted);
::      %wall is a wall-clock instant realized through pytz (zone=~
::      is UTC), which can yield two UTC spans in a DST fall-back
::      overlap or none in a spring-forward gap.
::  Which realization to fire, and whether a past occurrence still
::  fires, is the caller's decision.
::
::  Skipping an occurrence adds its index to except=; moving one is a
::  skip plus a separate %once event. Editing the recurrence reshapes
::  the index space — clear except= when you do. Zone names are pytz
::  names ('America/New_York'); an unknown name crashes — validate at
::  write time.

::  a kind is a clock: idx -> a naive local moment, nothing else.
::  start anchors idx 0. ~ = this index has no occurrence (april
::  31st, non-leap feb 29). args is a json object (self-describing,
::  never a raw noun); the kind reads its own args by key via +ja,
::  so the kind file is the single source of truth for its params.
::  The event layer (lib/calendar) dresses each moment with a shape.

::  the caller's mole — the event goes quiet rather than lying.
