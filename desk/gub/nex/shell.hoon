::  shell nexus: the home surface. Composes services — the launcher grid
::  (from the tiles store) and the notifications bell — over HTTP, and
::  owns the cross-ship discovery state: public.json, the derived
::  directory of this ship's shared desks, and /peers/, live mirrors
::  of other ships' directories.
::
::  Terminology — the shell/kernel distinction. The "shell" is the
::  userspace permission MANAGER: it reads apps' declared link.json /
::  weir.json, surfaces them, records what you consent to, and writes
::  weirs. It decides. The "grubbery kernel" (the runtime, formerly
::  "runtime") is what ENFORCES those weirs — the dart gate. So the
::  permits registry below lives entirely on the deciding side; the
::  stopping is the kernel's job. Manager vs enforcer, shell vs kernel.

  # The Grubbery Handbook

  Grubbery is a general-purpose application model for Urbit. A stock Gall app
  is one agent holding one big state noun, migrated by hand every time that
  shape changes. Grubbery takes the opposite bet: an application is a set of
  small **nexuses** composing over a shared **namespace** of content-addressed
  **grubs**, and all their work runs as restartable **fibers**. State doesn't
  live in an agent heap — it lives in the namespace, versioned and portable,
  and code reads it back on demand.

  Three nouns carry the whole model:

  - **Nexus** — the unit of an application. Declares what lives in its slice
    of the namespace, and answers requests against it.
  - **Grub** — the unit of state. One content-addressed file carrying a mark
    (its type).
  - **Fiber** — the unit of work. A monadic process that reads and writes the
    namespace and can be rebooted at any point.

  ## Why bother

  The payoff is how it scales. A monolithic agent gets *harder* to extend the
  bigger it grows — every feature entangles with one state and one event
  handler. Nexuses compose instead of entangle, so the next feature reuses
  primitives rather than thickening a core. And because state *is* the
  namespace, the two worst Gall taxes — hand-written migrations and cross-ship
  auth boilerplate — mostly evaporate.

  ## Where to start

  - [Nexuses](#nexuses.md) — the unit of an application
  - [Grubs & the namespace](#grubs.md) — where state actually lives
  - [Fibers](#fibers.md) — how work gets done

  ## This handbook is live

  > These pages are markdown grubs served by the shell nexus, and they quote
  > source **straight from the running ship** — no copy-paste, so a snippet
  > can't drift from the code it describes.

  Here is a whole nexus helper lib, read live from the namespace through the
  kernel's own file API and highlighted in place:

  ```live
  /lib/shell.hoon
  ```
  '''
++  nexuses-md
  '''
  # Nexuses

  A nexus is the grubbery unit of an application — a core with two arms:

  - **`on-load`** declares what persistently lives in the nexus's subtree of
    the namespace: the grubs it owns and their initial state.
  - **`on-file`** answers "given this file — a request, a timer, a
    subscription update — do the work." HTTP handlers and fibers live here.

  ## on-load: declaring your state

  `on-load` returns a *bole* built by `spin:loader` over a list of loader
  operations. The two you'll reach for constantly:

  - **`%fall`** seeds a grub *only if absent* — the runtime owns it after, and
    reloads never clobber it. For state edited at runtime.
  - **`%over`** *overwrites* on every load — the code is the source of truth.
    For assets and content authored in-source.

  ```hoon
  %+  spin:loader  ball
  :~  (manifest:loader 0)
      [%fall %& [/ %'main.sig'] [[/ %sig] ~]]      ::  a fiber entrypoint
      [%fall %| /cache empty-dir:loader]           ::  a rebuildable cache dir
      [%over %& [/ %'app.js'] [[/ %mime] app-js]]  ::  a served asset
  ==
  ```

  Getting these backwards is the classic footgun: seed content with `%fall`
  and it freezes at first boot; author it with `%over` and every commit
  redeploys it. It's the same record-vs-cache distinction as
  [Grubs](#grubs.md).

  ## on-file: doing the work

  Requests route in as the file that represents them. A nexus binds an HTTP
  path and hands off to a fiber:

  ```hoon
  [~ %'main.sig']
    ;<  ~  bind:m  (rise-wait:io prod "failed")
    ;<  ~  bind:m  (bind-http:io [~ /apps/grubbery])
    (http-dispatch:io %shell)
  ```

  The kernel routes matching requests here and spawns a fiber per request.

  ## Reading anything, live

  A nexus can read any file in the running namespace. Here's how a tool greps
  the whole ball — the same read primitive the live-code embeds use:

  ```live
  /lib/mcp/grep.hoon 53-64
  ```

++  grubs-md
  '''
  # Grubs & the namespace

  A **grub** is one file in the namespace: a path, a name, and a **blot** —
  its content plus a **mark** (its type). Marks are what let the system
  convert a grub on the way out — the kernel's file API serves a `.hoon` grub
  as text by running its mark's `mime` tube.

  The **namespace** is the shared tree of every nexus's grubs. It's
  content-addressed, so identical content is stored once and dedup'd across
  the whole system. Crucially it *is* the state — there is no separate agent
  heap to migrate when a type changes.

  ## Two tiers: record vs cache

  Not all state is equal, and grubbery keeps a hard line between:

  - **System of record** — authoritative state, the truth. Lose it and you
    lose data.
  - **Cache** — derived, rebuildable state. Lose it and you recompute it.

  The convention is to keep them in *separate sibling grubs* so the tiers are
  legible at a glance. The shell nexus does exactly this: consent records live
  under `/permit`, rebuildable views under `/cache`. That split is a design
  rule, not a suggestion — it's how you know, staring at an `on-load`, what's
  precious and what's disposable.

  ## %fall vs %over encode lifecycle

  The two loader verbs aren't just "seed" and "write" — they declare who owns
  a grub:

  - **`%fall`** = "owned at runtime; seed once." Record tier, or anything a
    user or editor mutates.
  - **`%over`** = "defined in code; overwrite." Assets, and content with no
    runtime editor yet.

  ## Reading a grub

  From inside a fiber you `peek` a grub by its road, optionally casting to a
  mark:

  ```hoon
  ;<  jon=(unit json)  bind:m
    (peek-as:io (nex-road:io rail [%& /cache %'weirs.json']) ,json)
  ```

  A `~` back means "nothing there" — a clean miss the reader handles, not an
  error.

  _TODO: content-addressing internals; the blot type in depth; marks and
  tubes; cross-nexus and cross-ship peeks._
  '''
++  fibers-md
  '''
  # Fibers

  A **fiber** is grubbery's unit of work: a monadic process that reads and
  writes the namespace, binds HTTP, peeks other nexuses, waits on timers —
  and, the whole point, **restarts cleanly from state** at any moment.

  ## The monad

  Open a fiber by naming its result type, sequence effects with `;< … bind:m`,
  finish with `pure:m`:

  ```hoon
  =/  m  (fiber:fiber:nexus ,~)
  ;<  now=@da         bind:m  get-time:io
  ;<  ~               bind:m  (bind-http:io [~ /apps/grubbery])
  ;<  wv=(unit json)  bind:m  (peek-as:io road ,json)
  (pure:m ~)
  ```

  Each `;<` line is one step: run the effect on the right, bind its result on
  the left, continue. Reads, writes, time, HTTP — everything sequences the
  same way, and the main arm reads top-to-bottom as the action it performs.

  ## Roads and weirs

  A **road** names a location in the namespace —
  `(nex-road:io rail [%& /dir %'file'])` addresses a grub relative to the
  nexus. A **weir** is a *capability*: the set of reaches a nexus declares it
  may make. Reaching outside your declared weir is refused — that's how
  cross-nexus and cross-ship reads stay safe without per-call auth checks.

  > An empty weir `{}` means "declared, with no holes"; an *absent* weir `~`
  > means "no filter at all." That's a real, intentional distinction — not a
  > typo to paper over.

  ## The restart contract

  The load-bearing invariant: **reboot at any time, recover from state.** A
  fiber isn't a long-lived thread you must keep alive — it's derived from the
  namespace, so the runtime can restart it whenever and it resumes from where
  the state says. This is why grubbery treats restarts as ordinary rather than
  hazardous, and why a loud crash is a *bug report*, not corruption to hide.

  code-style conventions (one-line binds, helpers in a bottom core)._

  ## Building real things

  - [ ] Serving HTTP: binding, static shell + data endpoints
  - [ ] The permission system: sources vs views, consent, enforcement
  - [ ] Desks: install, sync, follower model, publishing
  - [ ] Dynamic tools: `write_code`, `check_bin`, the MCP surface

  ## Why grubbery (the pitch)

  - [ ] A program vs a substrate: composition beats entanglement
  - [ ] Migrating a Gall agent: the strangler-fig pattern (see lattice)
  - [ ] The overlay pattern: keep source in your own repo, sync into gub

  ## Meta

  - [ ] The in-browser editor (`<code-editor>` + save)
  - [ ] A worked example, end to end
