::  shell nexus: the home surface. Composes services — the launcher grid
::  (from the tiles store) and the notifications bell — over HTTP, and
::  owns the cross-ship discovery state: public.json, the derived

::
::  Terminology — the shell/kernel distinction. The "shell" is the
::  userspace permission MANAGER: it reads apps' declared link.json /
::  weir.json, surfaces them, records what you consent to, and writes
::  weirs. It decides. The "grubbery kernel" (the runtime, formerly
::  "runtime") is what ENFORCES those weirs — the dart gate. So the
::  permits registry below lives entirely on the deciding side; the
::  stopping is the kernel's job. Manager vs enforcer, shell vs kernel.
