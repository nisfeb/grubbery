::  desk nexus: sync code from a remote source with snapshot safety
::
::  source.json holds source as JSON string — a path pointing DIRECTLY
::  at a code directory to mirror, anywhere in the namespace:
::    "~nec/apps/counter/desk/code"                (remote ship)
::    "/apps/foo.git_repo/data/tree/code"          (a checked-out repo)
::  The desk mirrors whatever dir you point it at into its /desk/code;
::  it assumes NOTHING about the source's internal shape.
::
::  Updates are version-gated: the source's code dir holds a version
::  file (any file named version.* whose mark renders to text). The
::  desk re-syncs when its content changes; the text is opaque, used
::  only as an opaque tag. Code can change freely on the source —
::  the desk won't update until the publisher bumps the version.
::
::  Layout — host/guest split:
::    source.json     source config            (host, root-governed)
::    version.*       release version          (host)
::    main.sig        HTTP UI                  (host)
::    /requests/      HTTP request grubs       (host)
::    /desk/code/     %code nexus synced from source — governs the
::                    guest world and nothing else. Carries the code
::                    plus bill.json, which declares which nexuses to
::                    create in /desk/data on first install (only when
::                    empty). bill.json is the ONLY desk-level file;
::                    everything a nexus says about itself (alias, weir,
::                    tile, icon) is per-nexus, declared in its own
::                    on-load and read by the shell's desk-data descent.
::    /desk/data/     working data for the installed desk
::
::  The host layer resolves marcs from the root code namespace; the
::  guest resolves against /desk/code. Guests distribute every marc
::  they use — content-addressing dedupes shared marcs for free.
::
::  Snapshots are world-level and live in the born history. Each is a
::  firm of BOTH /code and /data, tagged with a monotonic counter N
::  (snapshot.ud) — the fold pace lobe IS the merkle root of the subtree
::  at that instant. The initial snapshot is taken once; thereafter a
::  version change snapshots the current world before the new code lands.
::
::  Compose Live (do-compose) is the only thing besides source-sync that
::  mutates live: it snapshots first, then builds a new live world by
::  choosing code from {live | snapshot N | none} and data from
::  {live | snapshot M} — nullify code, load data, load code.
